Designers should keep in mind that real vents break easily, so if they are used for this purpose, then they must look visually sturdy to not break immersion. That being said, I think vents can serve other purposes, which is my primary intrest in them. I think there was one FNaF game that had decent vent design. The air vents served as another entrance you had to watch out for. Another game that kind of used air vents was GTA V where you need to gas an air vent, to clear a place out. </td><td class="s22" dir="ltr">6</td><td class="s23" dir="ltr">Grew up playing MGS.

As a nonbinary person, the gendering people perform of and within these spaces is also a point of tension, in addition to being an unnatural concept to me. In video games where you play a protagonist, typically they are gendered. Often games with normal settings featuring public toilets will restrict you from entering the &quot;wrong&quot; one - such as the Sims. Post-apocalypse or destroyed-world settings will often &quot;join&quot; the bathrooms via collapsed walls, un-gendering the spaces, providing the protagonist with &quot;permission&quot; to enter both or either. Thinking of fallout 4, which I played a lot of, every time I found gendered public toilets, they were in a pair, and connected this way. Why? Is it some squeamishness that causes the developers to do this? Problems with small dead-end rooms? <br>Nongendered toilets (such as those found within homes) are much less interesting to me.</td><td class="s20" dir="ltr">1</td><td class="s21" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve never played a game where they were more than crawl spaces. In the U.K., our air vents are tiny and uncommon, even in offices - I perceive them as a game trope that doesn&#39;t really correspond to a real-life thing.</td><td class="s22" dir="ltr">4</td><td class="s23" dir="ltr">They can be really immersive, or completely un-immersive, depending on how they are used. In skyrim or hyperspace delivery boy or dwarf fortress, they have purpose and meaning, as does their position and level of interaction. In Nier, they are unrealistic, meaningless props for puzzles. This distinction between set dressing, container, and game element is interesting to me.</td><td class="s24" dir="ltr">I&#39;m trans. Playing video games and finding the gendered space available to me was baffling and fascinating. Partly that the space was built the way it was - connected, &quot;allowed&quot;, but also that there was never the tension or threat that accompanies me into real life bathrooms.</td><td class="s25"></td><td class="s26" dir="ltr">At home - nothing interesting. In public - a constant challenge of knowing what toilets are around, are they gendered, which one is safer for me to go in, is it busy, will someone yell at me. It&#39;s hard.</td><td class="s27" dir="ltr">None of the above</td><td class="s28" dir="ltr">there&#39;s a strong push from the nonbinary community to de-gendering public toilets - the one in your house is unisex, after all. But games almost always depict public bathrooms as gendered, and rarely acknowledge trans people let alone nonbinary ones.<br>There&#39;s also a notable omission of accessible bathrooms, similarly correlating with the relative absence of disabled characters in games.</td><td class="s29"></td><td class="s30"></td><td class="s31"></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1918498696R72" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">73</div></th><td class="s16" dir="ltr">11/25/2017 12:25:51</td><td class="s17" dir="ltr">All of the above</td><td class="s18" dir="ltr">5</td><td class="s19" dir="ltr">i don&#39;t explore toilets much in video games; if they can flush that&#39;s cool but i usually don&#39;t go out of my way to see if they are interactive. </td><td class="s20" dir="ltr">8</td><td class="s21" dir="ltr">if vents are in a game it normally means they are going to have a significant role in such; i&#39;m worried about how much time i have to spend crawling through them. </td><td class="s22" dir="ltr">7</td><td class="s23" dir="ltr">same as the toilets but i might be more likely to explore them for looting potential. </td><td class="s24" dir="ltr">horror games--immersion/distraction from scary things </td><td class="s25" dir="ltr">--</td><td class="s26" dir="ltr">they make life significantly easier </td><td class="s27" dir="ltr">None of the above</td><td class="s28" dir="ltr">social value--immersion </td><td class="s29" dir="ltr">borderlands 2--the toilet opened and had the ammo i needed (all i used n the game were sniper rifles so i constantly needed ammo)</td><td class="s30" dir="ltr">amusing </td><td class="s31" dir="ltr">refer to previous answer </td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1918498696R73" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">74</div></th><td class="s16" dir="ltr">11/25/2017 12:54:05</td><td class="s17" dir="ltr">Game Developer</td><td class="s18" dir="ltr">7</td><td class="s19" dir="ltr">Personal spaces are a rare moment for grounding a fantasy space</td><td class="s20" dir="ltr">6</td><td class="s21" dir="ltr">They have tactical use, but have you ever seen a real air vent?

There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

I spend so much money on cigarettes and my family is deprived because i keep spending on cigarettes. I have been to many counselor and i have even been consuler at one point in my life but i just love cigarette. let me tell you a story. once upon a time, there was a little mason at the age of 2 - 1 years old. he just came out of the womb and saw the most glorius of sights...it was a doctor and he had....a stealthloscope. that image was burned into him mind so he broke his back and threw him out the window. he was angry... the doctor only bounces twice. so he also jumped out window but remembered he forgot he was still coneccted to his coooking mama. he started to hang himself with and umbrella chord but was too strong. he saw a woman on the ground level and she had....one of those. a cigarette. he transforrmed himself into kirby the hedgehog and gobblle like mother flipin chicken. he was so wet. he nosed dived down directly at the cigarette and ate them. it was in this moment he realized this wasnt just a story, it was the real deal. he felt punkd. he felt abandoned so he robbed a convenience store at gunpoint.

Otherwise, I tend to overlook them as just another fixture for the atmosphere. </td><td class="s20" dir="ltr">8</td><td class="s21" dir="ltr">Air vents can be a great mechanic in games, be it crawling though them, finding hidden objects within them, or having things blown around by them. For example in Outlast, climbing into the air vents to escape enemies and progress to new areas is exciting. Overuse of crawling through them can be frustrating. </td><td class="s22" dir="ltr">10</td><td class="s23" dir="ltr">Boxes and barrels immediately draw my attention in video games. They either contain items of interest, or are great hiding places. A very common item in many games, upon seeing a box or barrel, I am very likely to investigate them about 9 times out of 10. Unless of course, the object is clearly inaccessible. </td><td class="s24" dir="ltr">West of Loathing had a cute and clever way of utilizing toilets. </td><td class="s25" dir="ltr">No. </td><td class="s26" dir="ltr">I do think it&#39;s interesting that there are different kinds of toilets, and they can be a comedic topic of conversation. Such as how in Japan, there are seemingly primitive squatting toilets, or very high tech toilets, and no in between. </td><td class="s27" dir="ltr">None of the above</td><td class="s28" dir="ltr">Toilets can actually sometimes have an impact on the setting of the game. Different kinds of toilets are seen in different cultures. </td><td class="s29" dir="ltr">Corpse Party actually has my favorite toilet scenes. In the original 1996 game, Yuka needs to use the restroom and the stall is flooded with blood (this can lead to a bad ending if incorrect choices are made.) Then in Corpse Party: Blood Covered, Seiko Shinohara, who has gone missing is found hung in the bathroom stall, swinging above the in-ground toilet, just barely alive. Oh alright fine, one more. In Outlast, the character Richard Trager pulls out a large pair of shears from a urinal, which he then uses to remove your fingers. </td><td class="s30" dir="ltr">As an avid horror game fan, I like seeing things that are usually comical or completely overlooked being used to scare you, especially being done well. The idea of what may be comfortable no longer being safe is what I love in horror. </td><td class="s31" dir="ltr">Not quite relating to games - there&#39;s a true story about a duke who was murdered by an assassin hiding in his toilet. The assassin impaled him in the rear and left him, several days passing before the duke finally died from his injury. (Godfrey the Hunchback if you&#39;d like to look into it more.) Aside from that, like I&#39;ve mentioned, being able to flush the toilet to gain experience points in West of Loathing just cracks me up!
